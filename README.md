## Data
Data was obtained from [here](https://hackernoon.com/14-best-tableau-datasets-for-practicing-data-visualization).

## Process
I downloaded the data and then uploaded it into a Tableau workbook. I started by identifying four key areas of interest: Financial, Customers, Products, and Orders. I started with a bird's eye view looking at all four categories and developed a dashboard. Next I explored each area indiviudally, and then finished off with a time series analysis of financial categories.
