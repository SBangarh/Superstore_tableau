## Data
Data was obtained from [here](https://hackernoon.com/14-best-tableau-datasets-for-practicing-data-visualization).

## Business scenario
Company executives wish to understand Sales and Profits to idnetify key markets, products, and customers.

## Process
I downloaded the data and then uploaded it into a Tableau workbook. I used the business scenario above to guide my analysis and created dashboards to answer the scenario. 

I developed four dashboards:
- Sales/Profit: Ranked Sales and profit as a percentage of total and have sales and profit split by product category and customer segment
- Customers/Orders: Ranked the number of customers per state and the orders per state to understand location better. Added order count by product category and customer segment as well
- Customers: Ranked sales as a percentage of total by State and add the top 25 customers by Sales, Orders, and Profits
- Forecast: Sales, Profits, Orders broken up by customer segment over year/quarter. Added a forecast for better decision making.

## Results 
- California ranked first in Sales, Profit, Customers, and Orders. The Consumer segment drove sales with Technology being the most popular followed by Furniture and Office supplies. Interestly, Office Supplies had the highest profit followed by Technology and Furniture. 
- Texas was third in sales, but ranked 49th in profits which was interesting. The consumer segment drove sales in all three categories, but Furniture was most popular. Texas had negative profits in both Furniture and Office Supplies in all three segments.
- Technology and Office supplies appear to drive profits as opposed to furniture.
- The consumer segment is the largest segment and focused mostly on Office Supplies. This was true in the other segments as well.
- There appears to be little crossover in the top 25 customers for orders, sales, and profits.
- Sales, Orders, and Profits follow a seasonal trend where they start low, but increase throughout the year maxing out at Q4 each year.
- The max orders every year has an upward trend, but the max sales and profits are realtively stable or have minimal increase over time.
